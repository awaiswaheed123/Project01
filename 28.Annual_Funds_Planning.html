<h5>GHQ Level Budget Planning Process</h5>
<b>a.</b> EME directorate (EME-Budget) places demand of funds to CLS secretariat, approximately 6 months in advance of start of a FY, i.e. December of preceding year.
<b>b.</b> Effect based budget estimates are planned by Equipment Divisions (EME directorate) basing on factors like maintenance load, serviceability state of vehicles/ equipment/ aircrafts, sustenance requirements etc.
<b>c.</b> Simultaneously, similar planning is done at GS branch to plan procurement of new equipment from GS priority funds.
<b>d.</b> After finalization of requirement of ‘LS Priority’ at LS branch and ‘GS Priority’ at GS branch, consolidated requirement is forwarded to Budget directorate for further approval by COAS.
<h5>EME Directorate Level Budget Planning Process</h5>By 1 Aug each year, all SDs will submit requirements for sustenance stock while workshops will submit funds requirements for special repair projects, to concerned ‘Equipment Divisions’ (EME directorate). The ‘Equipment Divisions’ will collate, scrutinize, prioritize and trim these requirements to match available funds. It will be concluded in following steps:-
<h6><b>a. Step 1 – Special Repair Projects</b></h6>Funding requirements for LSP, repair of depot stocks etc. are consolidated. Following will be given due cognizance while finalizing this requirement:-
<b>1.</b> Adequate Loading of Workshops. Workshops are loaded as per capacity. Maximum efforts must be made to obviate field workshops from this responsibility; however, it can be done under compulsions.
<b>2.</b> RTLT Funds. Calculation of RTLT funds will be linked to assigned overhauling/ major repair tasks of the workshop.
<h6><b>b. Step 2 – Sustenance</b></h6>Its planning methodology is adequately covered under ‘Sustenance Spares Planning’, however it is summarized here. The annual sustenance requirements will comprise:-
<b>1.</b> SSL. It will be calculated on the basis of input provided by the SDs. SSL stocks will be planned for selected vehicles/ equipment (as intimated by EME directorate, by 31st May). Number of days will be decided by keeping in view available funds.
<b>2.</b> Additional Quantity of Time Based Replacement Items. Significant quantity of these items must already have been covered under SSL. However, if some quantity is perceived/ estimated over and above SSL the same will also be catered for.
<h6><b>c. Step 3 - A-in-U &amp; Capacity Building</b></h6>This requirement will be collated (as received from workshops &amp; SDs) and prioritized/ scrutinized as per available funds.
<h6><b>d. Step 4 – Finalization/ Approval of Budget Estimates</b></h6>Above funds requirement is summed up and segregated for processing under LS and GS priority funding. Same is normally approved by CLS in May each year and processed to Budget directorate.
<h5>Funds Allocation</h5>The funds are normally allocated to LS Branch/ EME directorate in Jul/ Aug each year. Thereafter these are allotted to EME establishments as under:-
<b>a.</b>CsEME / ADsEME are allotted LP funds directly by Finance Section ex CLS Secretariat, on recommendations of EME directorate.
<b>b.</b>EME directorate (EME-Budget) allots following types of funds:-
	<b>1.</b> RTLT funds
	<b>2.</b> A-in-U/ Capacity Building funds
	<b>3.</b> LP funds for Base / Regional workshops &amp; SDs
	<b>4.</b> LP funds for engine / vehicles overhauling at CEME level
<h5>Expenditure of Funds</h5>Maximum funds are earmarked for procurement of FOR/ FOB spares through Tier-1. Remaining, smaller percentage of funds is distributed to Equipment Divisions ex EME directorate for procurement of spares through SDs and Base / Regional Workshops. Field formations (CsEME/ ADsEME) are allotted LP funds by CLS Secretariat, directly.</pre>
