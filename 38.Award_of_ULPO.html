<pre><h5>ULPO Issue Criteria</h5>ULPO of an item will only be issued to the lowest bidder as established in the zonal CST. Procuring agency shall announce result of evaluated bid in the form of a report (CST) at least 10x days prior to the award of contract (ULPO)32. DP must be clearly mentioned in ULPO with due consent of supplier.
<h5>Lowest Evaluated Bid. </h5>There exists a myth about this term, that selection of lowest bid deprives one of acquiring desired quality. The same is nullified / clarified through definition of “Lowest Evaluated Bid” in PPRA rules33, which states:-
“It means
<b>1.</b> A bid most closely conforming to evaluation criteria and other conditions specified in the bidding documents and
<b>2.</b> Having lowest evaluated cost.”
<h5>ward to Next Bidder</h5>ANext lowest bidder may be approached for award of the contract / ULPO, if any of the following scenarios have developed and due to urgency of the required item, procuring agency does not have sufficient time to carry out rebidding by floating a fresh tender.
<h6><b>a. Case 1</b></h6>
<b>1.</b> The lowest bidder has not collected ULPO within ten days of date of issuance. (Communication record i.e. email, text message or postal mail etc. be kept for later references).
<b>2.</b> The lowest bidder has refused either in writing or verbally regarding non-provision of the demanded item.
<h6><b>b. Case 2</b></h6>The lowest bidder has not given response/ approached the contracting agency (SD/ workshop) after expiry of the DP as mentioned in the ULPO.
<h6><b>c. Case 3</b></h6>Supplied item has been rejected thrice by the inspection TOB.
<b>d.</b>In all of the above mentioned cases, ULPO will be cancelled and issued to the next bidder, preferably at the lowest rate mentioned in the CST otherwise at the rate quoted by the next bidder. Otherwise re-tender can also be initiated, if desired.
<b>e. Legal action </b>will be taken against the defaulter in light of PP&amp;I instructions34, under intimation to EME directorate. However, it is emphasized that DP mentioned should be realistic in nature e.g. 90 days for FOR import items etc.</pre>
