<pre><h5>Workshops Sustenance Stock</h5>
<h6><b>a. SSL Stock</b></h6>It will be maintained at LADs, field and C/B/R workshops. Salients are as under:-
<h6>(1) Field Workshops SSL Stock</h6>At EME battalions/ independent workshop companies; SSL stock is maintained to meet intimate repair support requirements of dependent units.
<h6>(2) C/B/R Workshops SSL Stock</h6>At C/B/R workshops; SSL stock is maintained to meet requirements of direct field support, only, e.g. for vehicles/ equipment reporting FRG or equipment deposited on DRWOs etc.
<h6>(3) Replenishment of SSL Stock</h6>The SSL stock will only be recouped/ replenished by concerned SD (using LP or CP resources), i.e. no LP will be carried out by workshops to replenish own SSL stocks.
<h6><b>b. Non-SSL Stock</b></h6>It is a temporary stock which comprises:-
<h6>(1) Old SSL Items</h6>Those items which were included in previous SSL, but have been excluded after review of SSL. These will be back loaded to SDs, if remain excluded for one year, i.e. two reviews.
<h6>(2) Urgently Required Items</h6>It is created due to LP of urgently required items and is not part of SSL. These are demanded as ‘Replacement Demands’2 from SD. In case of non-availability in SD stock, these can either be procured by workshop or SD (using LP resources). It is pertinent to mention that stores against ‘Replacement Demands’ are not to be stocked for longer period; these are supposed to be back loaded to SDs, if not required/ consumed due to any reason within one year.
<h6>(3) DXP Items</h6>It comprises serviceable stocks of minor assemblies. Usually when an assembly fails, it is because of a few worn out internal parts. As the rest of the assembly is still serviceable, therefore, it is less costly to replace the worn parts. The minor assemblies recovered through this process, at field workshops, are termed as DXP3 items. The repair of DXP items will be governed/ articulated as per EME directorate’s policy.
<h5>Formation Level GS Reserve Stock</h5>It will be maintained at EME battalions/ independent workshop companies and will be utilized during war/ operations. It is planned and released by EME directorate. However, periodic turnover with SSL stock can be planned and executed at workshop level without seeking permission from EME directorate.
