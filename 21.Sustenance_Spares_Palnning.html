<pre><h5>General </h5>Conventionally, spares sustenance is based on SSL concept6. However, there were some inadequacies which have been addressed in revised concept, as explained below. Timely processing of funds requirements necessitates annual ‘Sustenance Stock’ planning to be completed by 31st Dec each year.

<h5>Workshop Level Planning</h5>It will be carried out as under:-
<h6><b>a. Pre-requisites</b></h6>While finalizing requirement of ‘Sustenance Stock’, the workshops should give due cognizance to following,:-
<b>(1) Accurate Demanding Culture</b> Spares demands, at workshop level, form the basis of entire planning. Exaggerated demands should be curbed and all possible measures should be adopted to ensure it.
<b>(2) Fault trend</b> System/ subsystem wise fault trend data should be maintained vis-à-vis spares consumed (to rectify those faults). This will help in selection of critical items, out of SSL, to compensate for lesser funding.
<b>(3) Vintage</b> Ensure that the vehicles/ equipment are not being considered for down classification by sentencing committee (at GHQ, LS branch) within next one FY.
<b>(4) Any other factor</b> meriting consideration.
<h6><b>b. Estimation of Annual Requirements</b></h6>The requirement will be strictly calculated as explained in ‘Forecasting Methodology’, above, i.e. after catering for ‘Dues In’. The estimated requirement will cater for:-
<b>(1) SSL Stocks</b> Salients of planning &amp; maintaining SSL stock of spares has been explained at Annex ‘A’. Annually, balance ‘Replenishment Demands’ (as on 1st Jul) will be forwarded to concerned SD, by 1st Aug each year. The workshops will process balance requirements based on 30x Days SSL stock, however, exact number of stocking days will be finally decided by EME directorate (keeping in view the available funds).
<b>(2) Field Support/ SSL Requirements at C/B/R Workshops</b> In case SSL stocks for complete year are not available/ built at C/B/R workshops; estimated annual requirement for direct field support will be established and forwarded to concerned Equipment Division (EME directorate) by 1st Aug each year. It will comprise:-
<b>a.</b> Estimated requirements for FRG
<b>b.</b> Estimated requirements for equipment deposited on DRWOs
<b>c.</b> Any other field support requirement/ assigned task
<b>(3) Special Repair Projects</b> CsEME/ ADsEME/ Commandants C/B/R workshops will establish requirement of spares (with estimated cost effects) for assigned projects, e.g. LSP. This will be forwarded, directly, to concerned Equipment Division (EME directorate) by 1st Aug each year.
<h5>SDs Level Planning</h5> The SDs are responsible for planning/ maintaining own SSL stock of spares for meeting ‘Replenishment Demands’ of dependent workshops, as explained at Annex ‘A’. Its recoupment will be planned annually as under:-
<h6><b>a. Spares Quantity</b></h6>It will comprise balance ‘Replenishment Demands’ for recoupment of SSL stocks (own as well as dependent workshops), as on 1st Jul. The requirement will be forwarded to EME directorate by 1st Sep each year. Following will be ensured in this regard:-
<b>1.</b> It will be furnished equipment-wise to concerned Equipment Division (EME directorate). CEME/ ADEME/ Base workshop wise details should be readily available with SD for scrutiny/ analysis, if required.
<b>2.</b> Detailed cost effects will also be furnished along (basing on LPR or estimated cost).
<h6><b>b. Methodology</b></h6>The requirement will be strictly calculated as explained in ‘Forecasting Methodology’, above, i.e. after catering for ‘Dues In’. Following will be given due cognizance:-
<b>1.</b> CP contracts delivery timelines, implying segregation of urgently required items for procurement through LP.
<b>2.</b> Exaggerated demands, by field formation, should be guarded against. SDs will highlight such cases to EME directorate (concerned Equipment Division), whenever observed.
<h5>EME Directorate Level Planning</h5>After getting due input from SDs (comprising 30x Days SSL requirements), EME directorate will plan annual sustenance requirements as under:-
<h6><b>a. Stocking Decisions</b></h6>EME directorate will finalize the annual requirement of Sustenance Stock by 1st Nov each year, by deciding following:-
<b>(1) Selection of Vehicles/ Equipment</b> SSL stock will be built up for selected vehicles/ equipment. Selection of the vehicles/ equipment will be made by Equipment Divisions (EME directorate) while keeping in view the population, operational role/ requirement, impact and vintage etc.
<b>(2) Number of Days for SSL</b> Exact number of days for SSL stocks (for selected vehicles/ equipment, as mentioned above) will be decided by concerned Equipment Division (EME directorate). This decision can be varied from SD to SD and from formation to formation. Following will be given due cognizance, while making this decision:-
<b>a.</b> Available funds
<b>b.</b> Operational dictates
<b>c.</b> Criticality of equipment
<b>d.</b> Any other factor meriting consideration
<b>(3) Requirements for Special Repair Projects</b> Preference will be given to meet requirements of assigned repair projects, e.g. LSP. This requirement will be fed directly by concerned C/B/R workshops &amp; CsEME/ ADsEME to concerned Equipment Division (EME directorate).
<b>(4) Recoupment of TBR Items</b> Recoupment requirements for TBR items will also be included. It can be over &amp; above the SSL. As example; annual requirement of TTBs will be as under:-
<b>a.</b> Tyre/ Tubes 20% of the total held quantity
<b>b.</b> Batteries 50% of the total held quantity
<b>(5) Distribution of SDs’ Stocks</b> Distribution of stores within SDs will be made by concerned Equipment Divisions (EME directorate), while keeping in view the maintenance load, serviceability state and operational dictates in respective AOR.
<b>(6) Inter-Depot Transfer of Stores</b> Stores can be transferred from one SD to another for meeting operational requirements. It will be articulated and approved by concerned Equipment Divisions (EME directorate).
<h6><b>b. Procurement Decisions</b></h6>After finalizing requirement of Sustenance Stock by 1st Nov, concerned Equipment Divisions (EME directorate) will decide following by 31st Dec each year:-
<b>(1) Selection of Procurement Tier</b> Maximum possible efforts will be made to procure ‘Sustenance Stock’ through Tier 1. However, the same can also be procured at Tier 2/3, where considered essential e.g. special repair projects, impromptu/ urgent requirements etc.
<b>(2) Quantity Rationalization</b> EME directorate must critically analyse demanded quantity to avoid exaggeration. Necessary input will be sought from SD, wherever required.
<b>(3) Delivery Timelines</b> While planning, it will be kept in view that the planning is done 1-2 year in advance, e.g. the planning during FY 18/19, basing on data of FY 17/18, will cater for requirements in FY 19/20, less Tier-1 (CP) items (which will be delivered in FY 20/21). Therefore, EME directorate has to segregate urgent requirements so as to plan these for procurement through Tier 2/3 during next one year.</pre>
