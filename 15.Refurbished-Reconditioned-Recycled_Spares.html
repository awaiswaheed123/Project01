<pre><h5>Definition</h5>Refurbished/ reconditioned spare parts are used parts that have been cleaned and may have few external components replaced like nuts and bolts or gaskets. Recycled is just a different term for a used part.
<h5>DescriptionThese</h5> are very inexpensive compared to new parts. They are also very good choices for parts that donâ€™t wear such as door handles, trim, glass, mouldings or body parts. Used parts are the least expensive you can buy but they do have some level of wear and will not last as long as a new or rebuilt part. Never select a used part when it comes to safety e.g. while selecting brake, steering or suspension parts etc.</pre>
