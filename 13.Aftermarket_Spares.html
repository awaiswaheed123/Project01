<pre><h5>Definition</h5>Spare part that is made by a company, other than OEM. These are further sub categorized as replacement parts and auxiliary parts.
<h5>Description</h5>While these parts are usually made with the same materials/ specifications and made to serve the same purpose, they may have slight differences in how they look and feel. International aftermarket companies may analyse why specific OEM parts tend to fail and then improve on the original design or materials. Therefore, some aftermarket parts, due to redesign, may actually be an improvement on the original. Aftermarket companies may sometimes buy the rights to produce these parts or may be allowed to produce certain parts under Government law, to discourage monopoly (after certain period of time). Even though some might have a slightly different look, they perform somewhat satisfactorily, if not equal or better than the OEM part. Aftermarket parts are priced much lesser; making them a very good value. Judging quality of an aftermarket part is a real challenge; in some cases aftermarket part may outperform the OEM part while in other cases it can be otherwise.</pre>
