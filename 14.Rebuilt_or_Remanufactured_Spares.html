<pre><h5>Definition</h5>A spare part, essentially a used component that was completely taken apart and fitted with new sub parts. It is then tested to ensure that it performs as good as a new part (procedure done by the OEM only, this may not be true for locally reconditioned/ repaired parts).
<h5>DescriptionUsually</h5> when a part fails it is because of wear of few internal components. The rest of the part is still fine; therefore, it is less costly just to replace the worn out sub-parts.</pre>
