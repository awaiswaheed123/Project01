<pre><h5>Definition</h5>CST is record of the procedure, whereby Technical Oversight Board (TOB) shall ascertain; lowest evaluated bid24 from all the technical / commercial offers received from the bidders25 against an IT floated by a procuring agency. CST shall remain valid for a period of bid validity period mentioned in the bidding document26 published by a procuring agency for invitation to bid27.
<h5>Responsibility</h5>Preparation of CST, subsequent procurement and inspection of delivered stores shall be done under overall supervision of President TOB. TOB will formulate CST on zonal basis. CEME / base / regional workshops cannot have their own CST except for ‘Special items’ mentioned at Annex ‘D’.
<h5>When to Prepare CST? </h5>There is a myth about CST that it is required for all the items perceived to be procured in entire FY. If procurement methodology is understood correctly, this myth is negated. CST will only be prepared for ‘Open Competitive Bidding’ procurements. It should be prepared for minimum possible items and be updated when required. Maximum urgent demands should be met through ‘Alternative Methods of Procurement’ as explained earlier.
<h5>CST Compilation Format</h5>CST will be compiled / finalized in the MS Excel format attached as Annex ‘C’28. Same will be forwarded to EME directorate (EME-Budget) through concerned Equipment Division (EME Directorate), for uploading on eARMS.
<h5>Addition of New Parts in CST</h5>CST is a living document. Whenever an item is required to be included in the CST, concerned SD shall be informed by fastest means available to float IT and update CST.
<h5>Validity of the CST</h5>
<b>a.</b> CST should preferably remain valid for minimum 12 months and its validity may not be associated with the FY. The condition to this effect will be specifically mentioned in IT/ bidding document by making special reference to PPRA Rule 42c.
<b>b. Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) </b>to this effect (i.e. defining validity period) must be signed with the lowest and second lowest bidder. However, procurement agency will hold the right to cancel existing CST and call for fresh IT as and when deemed necessary.
<b>c. </b>Firms may also request for revision of existing CST, in case the items cannot be provided at mutually agreed rates due to reasons beyond control of the supplier. Such case shall be referred to TOB president for final decision. In case, reasons mentioned are unsatisfactory, than legal action shall be taken against the supplier in line with rules mentioned in PP&amp;I and DP-35.
<b>d. CST refresher process </b>should automatically start by concerned SD minimum 3 months prior to expiry period.
<b>e. Extension of Validity Period </b>Extension in validity period of CST, if deemed essential, shall be carried out as per PPRA Rule 26 (3) &amp; (4). It is pertinent to mention that if this relaxation is perceived to be availed in future, then the same should be explicitly mentioned in initial bidding document.
<h5>Package Deal</h5>“Package Deal” is allowed, conditionally. It is pertinent to mention that PPRA Rule 42 (c) (iii)29 is the relevant rule for the package deal.
<h5>Procurement Guidelines</h5>
<h6><b>a. Competition amongst Vendors</b></h6>Ensure creation of broad base competition among venders so as to achieve competitive low rates.
<h6><b>b. Single Stage - Two Envelope Bidding</b></h6>This is the recommended methodology for ‘Open Competitive Bidding’ procurement. Following be ensured:-
<b>1.</b> The bid should comprise a single package containing two separate envelopes. Each envelope shall contain separately the “FINANCIAL PROPOSAL” and the “TECHNICAL PROPOSAL”.
<b>2.</b> Initially, only the “TECHNICAL PROPOSAL” shall be opened, while retaining “FINANCIAL PROPOSAL”.
<b>3.</b> The procuring agency shall evaluate the technical proposal in a manner prescribed in advance, without reference to the prices and reject any proposal which does not conform to the specified requirements.
<b>4.</b> During the technical evaluation no amendments in the technical proposal shall be permitted.
<b>5.</b> After the evaluation and approval of the technical proposal the procuring agency, shall at a time within the bid validity period, publically open the financial proposal of technically accepted bids only. The financial proposal of bids found technically non-responsive shall be returned un-opened to the respective bidders.
<b>6.</b> The bid found to be the lowest evaluated bid shall be accepted.
<h6><b>c. Single Quote</b></h6>
<b>1.</b> A Single bid received in response to a tender, will be termed as a “Single Quote”.
<b>2.</b> On contrary if only one Bid is left over after rejection of multiple bids during technical scrutiny, it will not be considered as “Single Quote”.
<b>3.</b> PPRA rules do not put any limit on award of contract to single quote provided it meets the evaluation criteria expressed in tender notice and steps taken are not contrary to PPRA Rule 4 “Principles of Procurement”
<h6><b>d. Trade Link</b></h6>It is to verify complete trade link chain between the supplier and claimed OEM / manufacturer etc. The documents of trade link will be obtained during IT stage. Example of establishing trade link is given at Annex ‘L’.
<h6><b>e. Adherence to Rules</b></h6>Ensure that all relevant rules of PPRA, PPI and instructions issued by EME directorate are being followed during:-
	<b>1.</b> Lowest evaluated bid / CST.
	<b>2.</b> Preparation of ULPOs.
	<b>3.</b> Clearance of CRVs.
<h6><b>f. Price Reasonability</b></h6>Ensure that prices are reasonable vis-à-vis market rates. For this purpose, maintain LPR record of the past procurement. LPR is used as the reference point to judge that quoted price of an item is realistic or otherwise.
<h6><b>g. Package Deal Pre-requisite</b></h6>In order to facilitate subsequent conclusion of “Package Deal”, ensure that IT / RFQ has been prepared in assembly/sub assembly format.
<h6><b>h. Re-IT</b></h6>Procuring agency may reject all bids/ proposals at any time prior to acceptance of bids/ proposal in light of PPRA Rule 33. Some common reasons to carry out re-IT/ re-bidding, are as under:-
<b>1.</b> Rates received in a particular category of item has not been received or having unwarranted high/ low rates vis-à-vis LPR.
<b>2.</b> Additional items are required to be included in the RFQ /IT.
<b>3.</b> A part number/ nomenclature has changed or incorrectly published earlier.
<b>4.</b> Any technical reason considered necessary for carrying out Re-IT provided same is established &amp; recorded by proper forum.
<b>5.</b> Lowest bidder has repeatedly failed to deliver an item at lowest evaluated bid of an item.
<h6><b>i. CST Report</b></h6>Ensure that CST has been formulated, forwarded to EME directorate31 as per the format attached as Annex ‘C’ and uploaded on eARMS.
<h6><b>j. Use of CST of other Zones</b></h6>In the light of PPRA rules, the CST of other zones cannot be used; however, the price mentioned in other CST can be used as reference.
<h6><b>k. Procurement of Repair Materials/ Expendable Items</b></h6>Ordnance is responsible for provisioning of all types of repair materials/ expendable items. However, field and C/B/R workshops can carry out LP of emergent requirements for LSPs, after obtaining NA certificate from Ordnance depots.</pre>
