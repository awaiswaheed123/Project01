<pre><h5>Definition</h5>A spare part that was manufactured by a company which is a subcontractor to OM.
<h5>Description</h5>The part is exactly the same part as fitted in a vehicle/ equipment, when delivered ex-factory. However, it doesn’t have the vehicle/ equipment maker’s logo on it. For example, most fuel parts on a Volkswagen are made by M/S Bosch. Similarly, M/S Tong Yang (a Chinese company) is OEM part manufacturer of mirror and radiator for most Toyota and Nissan vehicles. These are exactly the same as genuine parts but are sold at lower rates, in comparison with genuine parts.</pre>
