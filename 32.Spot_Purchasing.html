<pre><h5>Purpose</h5>In order to facilitate fast track procurement through Army Defence Procurements (ADPs), a single page indent system has been introduced to meet urgent requirements.
<h5>Procedure</h5>MoDP has issued SOP / amplifying instructions for ADPs and DPs, through MoDP letter10. Salients are as under:-
<b>a. </b>Concerned SD / Workshop will forward details of required item to EME directorate.
<b>b. </b>EME directorate will raise spot purchase indents for the items/ stores affecting operational availability of the equipment / platform directly to ADPs on the format attached as Annex ‘O’. It will be forwarded directly to ADP.
<b>c. </b>Minimum essentially required specifications to ascertain the current items must be rendered as the initial stage albeit; it may take another page or two.
<b>d. </b>All ADPs will initiate procurement process immediately on receipt of spot purchase indent without waiting for CFA.
<b>e. </b>Value of the indent should not exceed the spot purchase power of the ADPs. However, if the quoted price/ rate of any indented item exceed the functional powers of spot purchase, the same will be processed by ADPs as per normal purchase procedure with intimation to all concerned indenter/ CFA and DP.
<b>f. </b>Financial Ceilings11. ADP may purchase each item / stores readily available in market up to USD 6,000, provided that the value of the actual contract does not exceed USD 12,000. Indents of higher value will not split to bring them within the purview of this procedure. For indents / items of less than USD 6,000, the ADP may purchase off the shelf or place order with the supplier. This will be through letter giving complete particulars / specifications of the items, terms of delivery / payment and any other conditions deemed essential by the ADP.

However, if the peculiar requirement of the country demands payment in other currencies like Euro, the ADP may maintain account and demand recoupment in the required currency while remaining within the cash carrying limit defined from time to time. EME directorate (EME-Budget) is responsible to ensure that imprest account has been opened with each ADP (Paris, London, Beijing, Russia, Washington) and arrange recoupment, as and when required.
