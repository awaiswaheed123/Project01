<pre><h5>Definition</h5> spare part that was originally fitted in a new vehicle/ equipment.
<h5>Description</h5>It comes in a packing with the vehicle/ equipment makerâ€™s logo so that a customer knows that the manufacturer of a vehicles/ equipment takes ownership of its design/ quality, whereas it was actually made by another firm. These are the spares which are sold under the brand name/ logo/ seal of the OEM/ OM of the main vehicles/ equipment e.g. Toyota, Mercedes, and Honda etc. Genuine spares are sold under warrantee/ guarantee of the main vehicle/ equipment manufacturer, thus are relatively more expensive. However, if bought in bulk, supplier firms do provide significant rebate.</pre>
