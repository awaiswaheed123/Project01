<h5>Replenishment of SSL Stock</h5>SSL stock is replenished through ‘Replenishment Demands’ placed on concerned SD. The ‘Replenishment Demands’ can be ‘Initial’ (fresh line items) or ‘Normal’ (to recoup held stock). The quantities demanded should be such that after all ‘Dues In’ and ‘Dues Out’ have been met; the stock balance will not exceed ‘Control Level’.
<h4>Criteria</h4>
<h5>Items Types</h5>It is based on past demands data, with following criteria:-
<h6><b>a. Line Items</b></h6>The line items listed should have 4 or more demands in a year. The 4x demands for this purpose will mean that a line item must be demanded on 4 or more separate demands, irrespective of the quantities in each demand.
<h6><b>b. Fringe Items</b></h6>Few spares / assemblies which are not qualified for shortlisting / inclusion in SSL but otherwise considered essential to be stocked and may be included as “Fringe Items” in small quantity in SSL and shall be marked as such. Adequate quantity of such ‘Time Based Change’ items (e.g. filters, batteries, tyre/ tubes etc.), which do not meet SSL criteria, will also be included in this list.
<b>c.</b> In case, non-availability of historic data, then items / spares categorized as “A”, “B” and “C” in Parts Catalogue Book of a particular vehicles / equipment may be included in SSL till the time sufficient real time historic data is not built up.
<h5>Lead Time for Procurement</h5>It is time required for procurement of an item. Following lead time will be considered for planning purpose. Lead time toward lower side will be considered if an item is being procured for the first time:-
	<b>a.</b> Locally available items (FOR items) 90-120 days
	<b>b.</b> Import based items (FOB items) 540-720 days
<h5>Safety Stock</h5>This stock is added in SSL stock, to cater for consumption of spares during lead time for procurement. This stock will be maintained at SDs only.
<h5>Control Level</h5>It is the quantity of an item selected for SSL that will be decided on number of days, for which an item is to be stocked; for example 30 days. The ‘Control Level’ is also referred as “Minimum Stocking Potential” (MSP) and “Days of Sup”. It will be decided by EME directorate.
<h5>Re-Order Point</h5>This figure represents the stock at which provision action is to be initiated. It will be 75% of the ‘Control Level’.
Calculation Methodology for Control Level
<h5>Variables</h5>
	<b>a.</b> Number of days
	<b>b.</b> Safety factor owing to lead time for procurement (SDs only)
