<pre>Procurement of genuine spare parts will always be preferred for repairing; especially for dynamic/ critical assemblies which are designed to undergo extreme revolutions/ hot temperature.
<b>Remaining categories</b> will only be resorted to in exceptional circumstances (non-availability / non-critical application / high cost of genuine spare parts etc.) after approval of competent authority (EME directorate). In case other categories are used, following will be ensured:-
a. OEM Spare Parts. The brand and country of production must be carefully viewed and ensured.
b. Aftermarket Parts. Only prefer those brands which have developed good repute in the international market. Avoid using an aftermarket part in a critical assembly/ equipment.
c. Reconditioned/ Rebuilt Part. It is not a preferred option. It can only be used in extreme exceptional circumstances, where the higher categories are not available and there is an emergent requirement of the part. However, if the item is reconditioned by OEM than it is acceptable.</pre>
